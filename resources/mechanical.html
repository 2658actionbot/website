                <h2 class="text-center">Wheels</h2>
                <p class="text-center">There are many different options for wheels to use on a robot. Different wheels apply to different drivetrains or mechanisms. Some drivetrains like mecanum, kiwi, and octoconum only work with the wheels they are designed to work with. However, other drivetrains like four, six, and eight wheel drive require the team to choose what types of wheels are best for the game and situation. Wheels are also used on mechanisms such as shooters and intakes. In mechanisms, different wheels are used depending on the different game pieces and situations. This resource page is meant to show all the wheels that can be used and to allow a basis off of which teams can make wheel choices for their robot.<br></p>

                            <p class="description">Compliant wheels are usually smaller in diameter than other wheels. These are most commonly used on mechanisms and never on drivetrains because of their small size, squishy nature, and bouncy attitude. Compliant wheels allow an object (usually in an intake mechanism) to push into the wheels, deforming them to hold the object more securely. There are three different levels of compliance depending on the color. Black is the softest, then blue, red, and finally green is the hardest compliance wheel. These wheels are the perfect choice for an intake that want a strong grip on an object.<br></p>

                            <p class="description">Performance wheels (the ones used on cars) are very similar to plaction wheels in most ways. There is the same interchangeable tread design and both support the same treads. One big difference with performance wheels is the metal build that allows a robust structure. While Blue Nitrile tread might be durable, plaction wheels aren’t always and can break because they are made of plastic. With performance wheels it is almost certain that they won’t break due to their robust, metal build. This makes performance wheels very robust and ideal for a drivetrain, but almost useless for a mechanism.<br></p>

                            <p class="description">Plaction wheels are plastic wheels that have interchangeable treads and a strong grip. The strong grip acts similarly to the Hi-Grip wheels commonly used. There are two types of interchangeable treads: Wedgetop and Blue Nitrile. Wedgetop tread has an X pattern repeated to allow for an “elevated” design where only the top part of that X touches the ground. This creates less friction compared to the Blue Nitrile grip most commonly used. Blue Nitrile tread is most commonly used for its durability and strong grip. Blue Nitrile grip has grooves going along the whole tread. These grooves dig into the carpet and catch on better than the Wedgetop tread’s X’s. The tread also lasts longer and wears slowly. All these factor make plaction wheels a great option and choice for a drive train for many teams. Plaction wheels are rarely used on mechanisms.​<br></p>

                            <p class="description">Mecanum wheels are ones with angled rollers. When a four wheel mecanum drivetrain is used, and each wheel is turned in a specific direction, all together in a specific combination, it allows the robot to move side to side. This is used for a versatile drivetrain. Mecanum wheels are rarely used for mechanisms.<br></p>

                            <p class="description">Omni wheels are wheels with rollers placed perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the wheel. These rollers allow the wheel and robot to glide with little to no traction. These are great for scenarios where you want the wheel(s) to slide around and give the robot more maneuverability. These are sometimes placed as the front two wheels in a standard robot drivetrain so that turning is easier. Omni wheels are almost never used in mechanisms.<br></p>

These are rubber wheels than can grab onto objects a bit so they don’t slide, but aren’t meant to grip tightly and never let go. They can be used for a mechanism that doesn’t require as much force. Colson wheels can also be used for drivetrains in a place where you don’t need deadly traction, but would like some maneuverability. ​<br></p>

There is little slide with these wheels and they are meant to be able to grip on. These wheels are great for rough terrain, going really fast, or gripping an object with force. There are three variations to the Hi-Grip wheel: Blue, Black, and White. The blue wheel is the softest, with the most “squish” on the outside. The white wheel is the hardest, with the least amount of “squish” on the outside.<br></p>

                            <p class="description">Stealth wheels, or low-friction wheels, are commonly used on the front of drivetrains or on some specific mechanisms. Stealth wheels are another option for a low amount of friction in the front of a drivetrain for quick maneuverability besides omni wheels. As with omni wheels, this allows the robot to twist and turn with ease in tight situations. Stealth wheels can also be used for mechanisms where there isn’t a strong need for force or grip. ​<br></p>

                            <p class="description">Pneumatic wheels are wheels pumped with air in them similar to what you would see in a bike or a car tire. These wheels are used for a small bit of compliance and a good tread. The pneumatic wheel can be used as a mid-range grip wheel for a drivetrain. Using two pneumatic wheels in the middle set of a six wheel drive can provide a gradual change in grip throughout the drivetrain (hi-grip in back and low-friction in front). Another option for pneumatic wheels is a mechanism like an intake, where these wheels will grip well and have a good compliance.<br></p>
